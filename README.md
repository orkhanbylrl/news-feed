## The idea of the project

The main idea of the project is to build a News feed-like application that collects news from all popular sources with an option to disable news from specific sources. 

## How everything should work: 
The algorythm that a new user should follow consists of the following:

1) Open the login page, choose the `Create account` option
2) Get redirected to the `Sign Up` page, fill in the form and press the `Create account` button
3) Get redirected to the login page, enter the newly created credentials and press `login`
4) Get redirected to the `Main Page`, where the user can see all the news from various sources. The user can click on an article to open it and read it. Upon clicking on an article - the `Article page` should open. The user can also search for specific articles
5) In order to disable news from specific sources, the user should hover onto his profile in the top right corner and choose the `My news` option. The user will be redirected to the `My news` page, where he can disable news from a specific source by clicking the `Dismiss this author` button. He can also search for a specific author by using the `Search` input box next to the `Disable news from specific websites` header.

### That's about it. However, there is one thing left. Please keep in mind that the websites are "Work In Progress", which means that some html/css/js files may change during updates. Also you can ask for whatever Front-End feature you want to be implemented and it will be so. Good Luck!
